NAME
     NNML::Server - a minimal NNTP server

SYNOPSIS
       perl -MNNML::Server -e 'server()'

DESCRIPTION
     NNML::Server server implements a minimal NNTP server. It is
     (hope-) fully conformant to rfc977. In addition the commands
     XOVER and AUTHINFO are implemented.

     Supported commands:

       ARTICLE, AUTHINFO, BODY, GROUP, HEAD, HELP, IHAVE, LAST, LIST,
       MODE, NEWGROUPS, NEWNEWS, NEXT, POST, QUIT, SLAVE, STAT, XOVER

     The main reason for writing this was to synchronize my mail
     directories across different hosts. The Mail directories are
     MH-Style with a .overview file in each folder and a active
     file in the base directory. These are maintained by the
     Emacs Gnus backend NNML. To get started, you can
     generate/update this files using the overview program. Upon
     POST and IHAVE commands this files will also be updated.

     To start from scratch use:

       touch /tmp/active;
       perl -MNNML::Server -e 'server(base => "/tmp", port => 3000)'

     To export your mh-Mail use:

       perl overview -base ~/Mail
       perl -MNNML::Server -e 'server(base => "$ENV{HOME}/Mail", port => 3000)'

     The command POST and IHAVE honour the Newsgroups header if
     not overwritten by the X-Nnml-Groups header. Articles will
     contain an appropriate X-Nnml-Groups header when retrieved
     by message-id.

AUTHORIZATION
     To enable access restrictions use:

       perl -MNNML::Auth -e "NNML::Auth::add_user($ENV{LOGANME}, 'passwd', \
         'read', 'write', 'admin')"

     If base/passwd exists, three levels of authorization are
     recognized:

     admin     Users with permission admin may shut down the
               server using SHUT.  Also these users may create
               new groups simply by posting to them.

     write     Users with permission write may use the POST and
               IHAVE commands.

     read      All other commands require the read permission.

BUGS
     The server handles multiple connections in a single thread.
     So a hung POST or IHAVE would block all connections.
     Therfore a post request is interrupted if the server could
     not read some bytes for 10 seconds. The Client is notified
     by message 441. If the client continues to send the article,
     it is interpreted by the command loop.

     The overview(1) and nnmirror(1) manpages.
